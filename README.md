# Important!

I am no longer maintaining this plugin for public use. 
If you would like to use it, you're going to need to fork it and
update it yourself. I would love for others to use this plugin,
but because no one else uses it and due to the amount of
personalization I have put into this plugin for my personal
server, I have no incentive to maintain it for public use.

If you'd like to help contribute still, go ahead.

# A bundle of helpful commands and features for QoL

Current supported version: **Spigot 1.21.x**

## Why?
I like Essentials and the commands that it provides, but as of recently, I don't enjoy the path they are taking with their plugin. So I made the stuff that I want myself.

## Features so far:
- Warps
- Gamemode command aliases (gmc/gms/gmsp/gma)
- Teleport requests
- Other commands, like /heal, /fly, etc...
- Custom chat formatting
- Custom welcome, join, and leave messages
Working on implementing more of the Essentials features that I like.

## Cool, I want to contribute!
Great! Here's some things that I'm working on right now that you could help with:
- Bugtesting
- The /seen command
- Code documentation (readability)
