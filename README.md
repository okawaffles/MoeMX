# A bundle of helpful commands and features for QoL

Current supported version: **Spigot 1.19.x**

## Why?
I like Essentials and the commands that it provides but as of recently they aren't being very nice to players who do not want to use Mojang's stupid chat encryption. So I made the stuff that I want myself.

## Features so far:
- Warps
- Gamemode command aliases (gmc/gms/gmsp/gma)
- Teleport requests
- Other commands, like /heal, /fly, etc...
- Custom chat formatting
- Custom welcome, join, and leave messages
Working on implementing more of the Essentials features that I like.

## Cool, I want to contribute!
Great! Here's some things that I'm working on right now that you could help with:
- Bugtesting
- The /seen command
- Code documentation (readability)
